# Story 1.1.1: Basic Map Display
gh issue create \
  --title "[Story 1.1.1] Basic Map Display" \
  --body "**As an** angler  
**I want** to view an interactive map of my area  
**So that** I can see nearby water bodies and potential fishing locations

## Epic
- **Epic ID**: Epic 1.1
- **Epic Name**: Interactive Map Integration

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] **Given** I open the app **When** I navigate to the map screen **Then** I see an interactive map centered on my location
- [ ] **Given** I'm viewing the map **When** I pinch/zoom **Then** the map scales appropriately with smooth animations
- [ ] **Given** I'm on the map **When** I drag/pan **Then** the map moves fluidly without lag
- [ ] **Given** the map loads **When** displaying **Then** water bodies are clearly distinguished from land

## Technical Requirements
- [ ] Integrate Mapbox SDK for web and mobile
- [ ] Implement geolocation services
- [ ] Configure map styling with water body emphasis
- [ ] Add zoom controls and user location indicator
- [ ] Optimize performance for mobile devices

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Code implemented and reviewed
- [ ] Unit tests written and passing
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Tested on web and mobile
- [ ] Accessibility requirements met
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met (<2s initial load)

## Dependencies
- [ ] Mapbox API key configuration
- [ ] Geolocation permissions setup

## Effort Estimate
**Story Points**: 5  
**Hours**: 8-12 hours

## Priority
**Phase**: 1  
**Sprint**: 1  
**Priority Score**: 95

## Testing Strategy
- [ ] Unit tests for map component initialization
- [ ] Integration tests for geolocation services
- [ ] E2E tests for map interaction (zoom, pan)
- [ ] Performance tests for load time and memory usage" \
