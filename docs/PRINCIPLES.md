# Design Principles

1. **Explainable**: every recommendation shows *why*.
2. **Offline-first**: plan + cached tiles work with zero service.
3. **User-owned data**: export logs/spots as GPX/CSV anytime.
4. **Safety-aware**: kayak wind alerts, daylight reminders.
5. **Vendor-light**: MapLibre/S3 option if Mapbox not desired.
